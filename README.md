# Password Generator Starter Code
## I started by creating variables for the different types of characters a user can select. I then created a function for the user to select how many characters they need in their password. This involved creating else statements for each positive selection, as well as an alert if no character type is selected. I then made a for loop which would generate the password randomly.
